<h1> Cute App</h1>

This exercise demonstrates the arrangement of images on a screen and basic button interactions. The app displays several images arranged in a specific layout, each of which is clickable/touchable. When the user interacts with an image, a `TextView` informs the user which image they interacted with, using a distinct color for the text. Additionally, a "Clear Text" button, which is initially invisible, becomes visible upon interaction with any image, allowing the user to reset the app to its original state.
